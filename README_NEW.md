python app.py
```

Visit `http://localhost:5000` to start verifying news!

## üî¨ How Real-Time Verification Works

### Step 1: Claim Extraction
The system uses advanced pattern matching to identify specific factual claims:
- Death/life status statements
- Current positions and titles  
- Recent events and announcements
- Statistical claims and numbers
- Geographic and political events

### Step 2: Search & Analysis
For each claim:
1. **Query Generation**: Creates targeted search queries
2. **Live Search**: Fetches current information via Google APIs
3. **Source Evaluation**: Assesses reliability of search results
4. **AI Analysis**: Gemini AI compares claims against evidence

### Step 3: Verification
- **Status Assignment**: TRUE, FALSE, PARTIALLY_TRUE, or UNCLEAR
- **Confidence Scoring**: 0.0 to 1.0 based on evidence strength
- **Reasoning**: Detailed explanation of assessment
- **Current Facts**: Up-to-date information as of August 2025

### Step 4: Final Assessment
- **Hybrid Score**: Combines real-time verification (60%) with ML analysis (40%)
- **Credibility Level**: HIGH, MODERATE, LOW, or VERY_LOW
- **Summary Report**: Comprehensive analysis with actionable insights
